  <!-- defination  of waste global  and country statistics regarding waste production and related issues-->
  <p> Waste-are classified as wasted material for which no further use is made by the owner or recipient as stated by the United Nation Framework for
    <br> Development of Environmental statistics.Waste is an emerging issue globally with the increasing global human population, technological
    <br>advancement in various field of science, art and commerce and the changing lifestyle.There has been a massive increase in the waste production
    <br>as well as an increase in the waste management issues associated with it.</p>
  <!--statistics and types-->
  <p> Globally, 2.01 billion tonnes of soiid waste are generated annually and it is projected to increase to 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050.Moreover,at least 33%
    <br>of this waste are not managed in a environmentally safe manner. In accordance, waste management is a concern at the national level as well especially
    <br>for the developing nations which lacks finance and infrastructures to manage the wastes. Similar is the case with Bhutan, a developing nation located
    <br> in the Eastern Himalaya bordered by two gigantic nations China in the north and India in the south. According to the nation's first waste inventory
    <br> report Bhutan, generates more than 170 metric tons of waste daily.Thus, managing these massive waste produced daily is a pressing issue growing
    <br> continuously over the decades. Waste is also associated to cause impact on the environment (that includes air, water and soil) as well as affects the
    <br> human health due to most of it being hazardous, sensitive and toxic in nature.</p>

  <p> In order to manage the waste efficiently globally as well as at national and grass root level various organizations, institution, non-governmental agencies
    <br> and individual have signed numerous conventions, framed various policies, rules and regulation.However, there is lack of assessment on the progress of the
    <br> initiatives once it is implemented.</p>
 <!--pie graph showing global waste treatment and disposal-->
  <p> Moreover, according to global waste statistics, more than 33% of the waste are dumped in open spaces and approximately more than 25.2 are disposed into
    <br> in the landfill(which are unspecified).Only 13.5% of the wastes are recycled thus, only a small portion of the waste is repurposed whereas most of it
    <br> is discarded and not properly managed despite having numerous other usable potentials.</p>
   <p> so, to efficiently manage the growing waste management issues and impacts related to it, sustainable ways are to be adopted and implemented by sustainable
     <br> souls. A sustainable development approach should be taken into action so that minmial waste is wasted and maximum portion of it is reutilized.</p>
